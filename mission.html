            <h2>The Litepaper</h2>
            <h3>Abstract: The Rebellion's Blueprint</h3>
            <p>$DEBT, an acronym for "Don't Ever Believe Them," is a decentralized cultural movement on the Solana blockchain. Its purpose is to serve as a digital symbol of defiance against a predatory global financial system built on debt. Through a combination of deflationary tokenomics, community empowerment, and a weaponized meme culture, $DEBT aims to build a self-sustaining ecosystem that rejects the status quo.</p>
            
            <h3>Tokenomics: The Arsenal of the Rebellion</h3>
            <p>Designed for safety and transparency. 0% Tax, Renounced Contract, and Burned LP. The supply is deflationary by design, with over 66M tokens already burned. The Treasury of 150M tokens is locked on-chain until July 2026 to fund future, community-voted growth.</p>

            <h3>Roadmap: The Path to Victory</h3>
            <p>Our roadmap is a three-phase assault: **Ignition** (launch and foundation), **Escalation** (ecosystem growth via NFTs and partnerships), and **The Great Default** (full decentralization via a community-governed DAO).</p>

                        <p>$DEBT, short for "Don't Ever Believe Them," is a decentralized rebellion against the elite-controlled financial system. Our mission is to empower the 99% by exposing the lies of a debt-based world.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Yes. Trust is earned through action. The contract was renounced at launch, the liquidity pool (LP) was burned, and there are no transaction taxes. A community treasury is used transparently for project growth.</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>Our vision is to expand $DEBT into a full "tokenverse." The next major step is launching an NFT collection where users can stake their NFTs to earn $DEBT rewards, followed by a community-governed DAO to take full control of the project's future.</p>
