            <h2>Abstract: The Rebellion's Blueprint</h2>
            <p>$DEBT, an acronym for "Don't Ever Believe Them," is more than a memecoin; it is a decentralized cultural movement on the Solana blockchain. Launched on July 21, 2024, by founder <a href="https://x.com/AutopsyT2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopsy</a>, its purpose is to serve as a digital symbol of defiance against a predatory global financial system built on debt. Through a combination of deflationary tokenomics, community empowerment, and a weaponized meme culture, $DEBT aims to build a self-sustaining ecosystem that rejects the status quo and champions financial sovereignty for the 99%.</p>

            <h2>The Manifesto: The Problem</h2>
            <p>The modern world is built on a lie sold to us as progress: a system of inescapable, generational debt designed to enrich the few at the expense of the many. Financial institutions forge digital chains, central banks print currency into worthlessness, and the masses are told this is the only way. This system is a prison disguised as a dream. $DEBT was created as a glitch in this machine—a crowbar to pry open the system and a testament to the power of a collective that refuses to comply. The great default is not just a market crash; it is a conscious decision to reject the terms of our enslavement.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ff7777; font-weight: 700; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Deflationary by Design</h3>
            <p>Unlike fiat currencies which inflate into infinity, $DEBT is designed to become scarcer over time. To date, over <strong>66 Million tokens have been permanently burned</strong>. Future burns are planned to commemorate community-driven milestones, forever reducing the total supply.</p>
            
            <h3 style="color: #ff7777; font-weight: 700; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">Community-First Distribution</h3>
            <p>From its inception, $DEBT has been a project for the people. Over <strong>100 Million tokens</strong> have been distributed directly to community members through airdrops and events, including the "Debtmas" airdrop of 30 Million tokens to holders.</p>

            <h3 style="color: #ff7777; font-weight: 700; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">The Treasury: A War Chest for the Future</h3>
            <p>A total of <strong>150 Million tokens</strong> are secured in a time-locked contract, set to unlock on July 21, 2026, and return to the treasury wallet (`debtculture.sol`). The locked funds are publicly viewable on <a href="https://app.streamflow.finance/project-dashboard/solana/mainnet/9NQc7BnhfLbNwVFXrVsymEdqEFRuv5e1k7CuQW82pump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Vault Tracker</a> and are reserved exclusively to propel the project forward through DAO-voted initiatives, staking rewards, strategic airdrops, and marketing campaigns.</p>

            <h2>Roadmap: The Path to Victory</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase 1: IGNITION (Completed)</strong> - Launched the token, renounced the contract, burned liquidity, and established our digital command center at DebtCulture.xyz and core social channels. Initial airdrops and meme offensives were deployed.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2: ESCALATION (Current)</strong> - Focus on expanding the ecosystem's utility and reach. This phase is defined by the launch of the official NFT collection, strategic partnerships, and the rollout of the first merchandise line.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3: THE GREAT DEFAULT (Future)</strong> - The full decentralization of the project. This phase will see the deployment of a community-governed DAO, the integration of $DEBT as a utility token in games and platforms, and a mainstream push to awaken the masses to our cause.</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="paper-section">
            <h2>Project Escalation: The NFT Collection</h2>
            <p>The next major offensive in our rebellion is the launch of a <strong>777-piece NFT collection</strong> (official name to be revealed). These are not just profile pictures; they are symbols of status within the rebellion and keys to earning within our ecosystem.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Utility:</strong> Holders will be able to stake their NFTs to earn passive $DEBT rewards, creating a powerful synergy between holding the token and the NFT.</li>
                <li><strong>Distribution Strategy:</strong>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 20px;">
                        <li><strong>277 Airdropped/Claimable:</strong> Rewarded to loyal $DEBT holders based on a tiered snapshot of holdings.</li>
                        <li><strong>100 Presale:</strong> Available for purchase at a discount exclusively using $DEBT.</li>
                        <li><strong>100 Marketing & Giveaways:</strong> Reserved for partnerships and community contests.</li>
                        <li><strong>300 Public Mint:</strong> The remaining supply will be available for public minting.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                 <li><strong>Economic Engine:</strong> All proceeds from the NFT sale will be used to propel the token's growth. All secondary market royalties will be used to execute <strong>$DEBT buybacks</strong>, creating continuous buying pressure. The $DEBT collected from the presale will be strategically split: <strong>50% will be permanently burned</strong> and <strong>50% will be added to the NFT staking rewards pool</strong>.</li>
